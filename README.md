## Overview

### The challenge

This a challenge for build Clone-Template which user should be able to:

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- be responsive for all screen sizes
- using html ,css and bootstrap only

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- bootstrap

### What I learned

it was a greate time to use html ,css and a lot of bootstrap ,
